If you want to add these cars to your fiveM server you
can go to your server CFG and write:

ensure: [FNBP]
start: [FNBP]

Now, if you use TxAdmin, you might need to go to the
resource thingy inside of TxAdmin, then scroll untill you
find the pack, now all you want to do is:

1. Turn on every one of the mods
2. Check if they are on
3. Restart the server (might be glitchy if you dont)
4. Enjoy!
